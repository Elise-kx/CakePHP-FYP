# CakePHP Project: Booking System & Admin dashboard
> **Note:** Due to confidentiality agreements, the source code is not publicly available.  
> This repository serves as a **project overview** to showcase my work on a real-world PHP application.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project involved developing a **fully customised booking system** and **admin dashboard** from scratch for a **pram cleaning business**. The project was developed following **Agile methodologies**, enabling continuous collaboration with the client and quick adaptation to changing requirements.  

The clientâ€™s previous booking solution, built on WordPress, had several restrictions that limited their ability to provide accurate information and options, and track service progress. My goal was to create a tailored system that **solved these pain points** while improving operational efficiency.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- **Replace WordPress limitations** with a scalable, flexible booking solution.
- **Automate and streamline** the entire booking-to-payment process.
- Provide an **admin dashboard** for:
  - Managing services and store branches.
  - Monitoring staff tasks and progress.
  - Updating booking statuses in real time.
- Ensure **real-time synchronisation** between customer bookings and admin management to avoid time slot collisions.
- Enhance user experience with **secure payment integration** and **location mapping**.

## ðŸŽ¯ My Role
- Developed frontend AND backend features in **PHP (CakePHP Framework)**.
- Integrated third-party payment API (**Stripe**) for secure online transactions.
- Created dynamic form handling and booking workflows.
- Collaborate with students from other IT principles through the SDLC.
- Communicate with client and showcase deliverables during weekly meetings for updates and feedbacks.
- Worked within an **Agile team environment**, participating in regular stand-ups, reviews, and iterative development to meet client needs.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Language:** PHP v8.2.12
- **Framework:** CakePHP v5.0
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 5), JavaScript, jQuery
- **Web Hosting** cPanel
- **APIs & Integrations:**
  - Stripe Payment API
  - Google Maps API
- **Version Control:** Git

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- Customer-facing booking system with availability checks.
- Admin dashboard for service, branch, and booking management.
- Role-based access for business owner and staff.
- Real-time sync to prevent booking conflicts.
- Secure online payments with Stripe.
- Store location mapping with Google Maps.
- Authentication AND authorisation
- Image uploads/modifications
- Content management (basic CMS)

## ðŸ’¡ Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Dynamically updating available time slots based on the business hours set in the admin dashboard.  
  **Solution:** Created a JavaScript-based front-end logic that fetches the updated opening hours and regenerates the available time slots in real time, ensuring customers can only book valid times.
  
- **Challenge:** Preventing double-charging in payment flow.  
  **Solution:** Designed success-page-only payment confirmation logic.

- **Challenge:** Designing an efficient ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) that supports all features. Midway through the project, the client requested structural changes, and we also identified a more optimal approach for data relationships.  
  **Solution:** Revised the database schema to improve normalisation, scalability, and data integrity while accommodating the new client requirements without disrupting existing development progress.
